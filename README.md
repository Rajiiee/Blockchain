## Overview

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of a basic blockchain. It demonstrates fundamental blockchain concepts such as blocks, hashes, and chain validation.

## Features

- **Block Structure:** Defines a block with timestamp, data, and hash.
- **Hashing:** Utilizes SHA-256 for hashing block contents.
- **Chain Validation:** Validates the integrity of the blockchain.
- **Basic Mining:** Simple proof-of-work mining mechanism.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Allows interaction with the blockchain via CLI commands.
